# Overture: An Introduction to ConSerts

*Conditional Safety Certificates* (ConSerts) offer a novel way to assure the safety of open and adaptive systems.
They work in a model-based manner, leveraging type systems, boolean success trees, and demand-guarantee logic to formalize safety concepts.

This book is an introduction to the concept of ConSerts, showing their [use cases](./example/system.md), integration in the overall [systems safety process](./conserts-lifecycle.md), as well as details on the implementation (both during [design-](./times/design.md) and [runtime](./times/evaluation.md)).
The book is targeted towards practitioners and aims to provide a go-to-reference for learning more about ConSerts, an approach that has so far been primarily accessible in the form of [scientific publications](./science.md).

This book is authored by [Fraunhofer IESE](https://www.iese.fraunhofer.de/), but intended to be open-source so that other authors can contribute their experiences, use cases, or additions with respect to ConSerts.
More legal details can be found [here](./legal.md).
